1) bash startup file is ~/.bash_profile.  So i will add a line in that file to set up my environment.
   source /cygdrive/d/MyProgEnviron/config/bashrc
   You may also want to put this line at the end of ~/.bashrc, because when you use xterm to open a
   new shell, only ~/.bashrc will be executed. ~/.bash_profile is only executed by login shell.

2) R startup file is at C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.1\etc\Rprofile.site.  So i will add a line in that 
   file to source my own config file.
   source("D:\\MyProgEnviron\\config\\Rprofile")

3) vim config.  The default vim config file is ~/.vimrc. I will write a personal vim config file
   and add a line in ~/.vimrc file to source mine.
   source /cygdrive/d/MyProgEnviron/config/vimrc

   In my vimrc file. 
   *) downdown zenburn color scheme http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=415
      downdload either the .vba or .vim file depending on your vimball version.  It seems that
      only .vim version works on my computer. 
   *) create ~/.vim/colors directory, copy the downloaded color into that folder.
   *) in .vimrc file, add the line
      colorscheme zenburn
      or when you already inside vim editing something, you can turn the color scheme on by typing
      :colorscheme zenburn
   *) I want the high contrast version, so I 
      let g:zenburn_high_Contrast=1
